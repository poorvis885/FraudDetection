💰 Financial Fraud Detection System
using C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms
📖 Overview
This project is a high-performance Financial Fraud Detection System, designed to analyze financial transactions and detect possible fraudulent activities in real-time using efficient C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

It focuses on identity theft, payment fraud, and unauthorized transactions by leveraging optimized search, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection techniques.

⚙️ Features
✅ Real-time transaction analysis
✅ Detect suspicious transaction patterns
✅ Identity verification and mismatch detection
✅ Blacklist-based fraud detection
✅ Customizable threshold settings
✅ Fast and optimized using core C++ STL + DSA
✅ Console-based user interface (CLI)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C++ (C++17)

DSA: HashMaps, Graphs, Trees, Heaps, Sliding Window, Dynamic Programming

Algorithms: Pattern Matching, Anomaly Detection, Thresholding

IDE: VS Code / CodeBlocks / CLion

Version Control: Git

📊 Sample Workflow
1️⃣ Load transactions from CSV / DB
2️⃣ Use HashMaps for fast lookup of blacklisted users/accounts
3️⃣ Use Heaps to track unusual transaction patterns (e.g., big amounts in short time)
4️⃣ Graphs to detect transaction loops/cycles (possible fraud rings)
5️⃣ Alert generation for detected frauds
