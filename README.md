💻 Financial Fraud Detection System
(C++ | Data Structures & Algorithms Project)
📝 Description
A high-performance financial fraud detection system built using C++ and efficient Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
The system analyzes large volumes of transaction data to identify patterns of fraudulent activity, including:

Identity theft

Payment fraud

Unauthorized transactions

Suspicious behavioral patterns

Optimized for real-time detection, this system is suitable for integration into financial institutions or digital payment platforms.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Real-time transaction monitoring
✅ Detection of suspicious patterns (velocity checks, frequency spikes)
✅ Blacklisted account verification
✅ Anomaly detection using advanced DSA techniques
✅ Graph-based fraud ring detection (cycle detection)
✅ Efficient search and pattern matching
✅ Command-line interface for demonstration & testing

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: C++17

Core Concepts Used:

Hash Maps

Min/Max Heaps

Graph Algorithms (DFS for cycle detection)

Sliding Window Algorithms

Dynamic Programming

CSV File Parsing

OOP Design Principles
