💻 Project Title
Financial Fraud Detection System (C++ / DSA Project)

📝 Description
This project implements a Financial Fraud Detection System using efficient C++ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
It analyzes financial transaction data to detect patterns of fraudulent activity such as:

Identity theft

Payment fraud

Unauthorized or suspicious transactions

The system is built for speed and accuracy, optimized for real-time detection using core C++ and algorithmic techniques — no external frameworks.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time transaction processing

Suspicious pattern detection (amount spikes, velocity checks, duplicate accounts)

Blacklisted account verification

Anomaly detection using algorithmic models

Fast searching using HashMaps and Heaps

Cycle detection using Graph algorithms

CLI-based interface for demo & testing

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: C++17
Concepts used:

Hash Maps

Heaps

Graphs (DFS for cycles)

Sliding window algorithms

Dynamic programming for threshold patterns

File handling (CSV parsing)
